This is a simple kanban board project to help keeping track of daily tasks. 

Getting started:

1. Install Parcel for bundling if not already installed (npm install -g parcel-bundler)
2. Run "npm install"

For development server, run "parcel ./src/index.html".
To build, run "parcel build ./src/index.html". This creates bundles production files under /dist.
